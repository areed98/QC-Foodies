## Description


# The Project - A food blog created by 4 individuals based in Charlotte, NC. 

Here, you can share your thoughts on different dishes from: 

- restaurants
- recipes 
- specific restaurants

For the fun time lovers who replace their food with drinks, we offer a brewery option as well. 

Navigate through the page, utilizing the homepage or the navbar on the top of the page. 

Log-in to keep up with other QCFoodies and interact with them as well. Create your own post (including a photo) or add a comment on other user's posts based on your experience if you had the same food or drink. Rate or like the post. 

QC Foodies is Charlotte based however open to the Foodie post from other areas of the world! Share your favorites with other interested foodies! 

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
